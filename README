interactions.tsv.gz
    Contains pairwise interactions generated by elton 0.5.0 on 2018-06-29 . 
    Generated by dietmatrix.sh . 

fbPredPreyOrder.tsv.gz
    Contains prey/diet items of species known to fishbase. For prey/diet items, the linked order(s) are included as well as the resolved prey/diet item terms. Calculated by dietmatrix.sh .

majorityOrders.tsv
    Majority order were calculate by selecting the most frequently occurring order associated with a specific prey id/name.
    If different order assignments for a particular prey item have same frequency, the orders are sorted in alphabetical order and the first is selected.
    So, lets say that species X maps to only orders A and B. There's no majority order, and A is selected because it is the first name in alphabetical order.

minorityOrders.tsv
    Minority order are the orders that occur that are not majority orders.


fbPredPreyMajorityOrder.tsv.gz
    Contains an estimate of diet order associated with prey based on GloBI. 
    Generated using calcMajorityOrders.scala using input generated from dietmatrix.sh  

fbPredPreyMajorityOrderCount.tsv
    Contains an estimate of diet order diversity based on GloBI.
    Calculated by taking fbPredPreyOrder.tsv.gz (generated by dietMatrix.sh), and determining majority orders.
    Then, only select majority orders for selected prey id/name, and generated a distinct list of all orders consumed by a specific predator.
    Apache Spark scala code to do this transformation can be found in calcMajorityOrders.scala .

    has columns:
    1. predator fishbase spec id
    2. predator species name
    3. number of distinct majority prey orders recorded for this predator
    4. total number of majority orders

fbPredPreyOrderPreyFrequency.tsv
    contains a sorted frequency count of unique prey item-order pairs that occur in used intermediate fbPredPreyOrder.tsv.gz file. Used to detect suspicious prey items.
