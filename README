Appendix to "A global assessment of the biological and environmental drivers of the trophic ecology trophic ecology of 2,580 marine fishes" . B Hayden, MLD Palomares, BE Smith. and JH Poelen. (in preparation)

This repository contains final and intermediate data files of a diet matrix for fish known to both Fishbase (https://fishbase.org) and species interaction datatsets indexed by Global Biotic Interactions (https://globalbioticinteractions.org). In addition, the script dietmatrix.sh contains the steps used to build the data files. A log associated with the creation of the included files can be fonud in dietmatrix.log. This file contains things like the linux operating system used and version of the various tools (e.g., nomer, elton, spark-shell). 

Prerequisites:

elton, nomer and spark-shell v2.4+

To reproduce the results, please run:

bash -s <dietmatrix.sh &>dietmatrix.log

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 .

Contents:

dietmatix.sh
    script used to generate data files.

dietmatrix.log 
    Log of most recent run of dietmatrix.sh.

interactions.tsv.gz
    Contains pairwise interactions. 
    Generated by dietmatrix.sh . 

fbPreyPredSameAsWithOrder.tsv.gz
    Contains resolved prey ids/names, where first two columns are the provided prey id/names and the columns 6-11 contains name/id/rank for lowest rank (e.g., species, genus) and name/id/rank for associated order taxon respectively. 

fbPreyPredNotSameAsWithOrder.tsv.gz
    Same as fbPreyPredSameAsWithOrder.tsv.gz, only including all the prey items that did *not* match to any known name/id/rank. This file and associated file can be used to estimate the number of prey name mismatches

fbPredPreyOrder.tsv.gz
    Contains prey/diet items of species known to fishbase. For prey/diet items, the linked order(s) are included as well as the resolved prey/diet item terms.

majorityOrders.tsv
    Majority order were calculate by selecting the most frequently occurring order associated with a specific prey id/name.
    If different order assignments for a particular prey item have same frequency, the orders are sorted in alphabetical order and the first is selected.
    So, lets say that species X maps to only orders A and B. There's no majority order, and A is selected because it is the first name in alphabetical order.

minorityOrders.tsv
    Minority order are the orders that occur that are not majority orders.

fbPredPreyMajorityOrder.tsv.gz
    Contains an estimate of diet order associated with prey based on GloBI. 

fbPredPreyMajorityOrderCount.tsv
    Contains an estimate of diet order diversity based on GloBI.
    Calculated by taking fbPredPreyOrder.tsv.gz and determining majority orders.
    Then, only select majority orders for selected prey id/name, and generated a distinct list of all orders consumed by a specific predator.
    Apache Spark scala code to do this transformation can be found in calcMajorityOrders.scala .

    has columns:
    1. predator fishbase spec id
    2. predator species name
    3. number of distinct majority prey orders recorded for this predator
    4. total number of majority orders

fbPredPreyOrderPreyFrequency.tsv
    contains a sorted frequency count of unique prey item-order pairs that occur in used intermediate fbPredPreyOrder.tsv.gz file. Used to detect suspicious prey items.
